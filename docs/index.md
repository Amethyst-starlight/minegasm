Minegasm is a Minecraft (Java Edition) Forge mod that uses connected sex toys to enhance the gameplay experience. This mod is intended to be used only by consenting adults.

## Download
JAR file: [minegasm-0.1.1.jar](https://github.com/RainbowVille/minegasm/releases/download/v0.1.1/minegasm-0.1.1.jar)

### Dependencies
1. Intiface Desktop: [https://intiface.com/desktop/](https://intiface.com/desktop/)
2. Minecraft Forge - MC 1.16.3: [http://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.16.3.html](http://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.16.3.html)

## How to Use
1. Make sure you have all the dependencies installed.
2. Download the JAR file and put it in your mods directory. If you don't know where your mods directory is, you can simply open your Minecraft, click the 'Mods' button on the main menu, then click 'Open Mods Folder'.
3. Run the Intiface Desktop and turn on the Regular Websockets server (on 127.0.0.1:12345).
4. Turn on the device.
5. Start Minecraft and connect to a world. If everything works properly, your device should vibrate once when you enter the world. You might need to restart your Minecraft if you already have it open before you started the Intiface server.
6. Have fun!

## Supported Devices
In theory, this mod should be compatible with any devices on this list: [IoST Index â€“ Vibrators with Buttplug.io Support](https://iostindex.com/?filter0ButtplugSupport=4&filter1Features=OutputsVibrators)

It has been confirmed to work with:
- [Lovense Edge](https://www.lovense.com/r/qvl9jn) (prostate massager)
- [Lovense Hush](https://www.lovense.com/r/zrzb5e) (butt plug)
- [Lovense Max 2](https://www.lovense.com/r/n4x2bh) (male masturbator)

## Troubleshooting
As with a lot of computer issues, the very first thing you should try is to restart everything. While not strictly necessary, we recommend that you start your device and the Intiface server before Minecraft. This should solve most intermittent issues.

If you run this mod alongside other mods, try disabling them all first and then reenable them one by one when the mods run successfully. If you found any mods that are incompatible with this mod, please file an issue on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/RainbowVille/minegasm/issues).
